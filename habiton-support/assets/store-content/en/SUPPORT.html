    <div class="faq-question">How do I delete a habit?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        Tap on a habit in your daily list to view details, then use the delete option at the bottom of the screen.

    <div class="faq-question">How are streaks calculated?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        Streaks count consecutive days you've completed a habit according to its frequency. If a habit isn't scheduled for a particular day, it doesn't break your streak.
    </div>

        All data is stored locally on your device. If you delete the app, your data will be permanently removed.
