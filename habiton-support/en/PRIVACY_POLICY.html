    <h1>Privacy Policy for HabitOn</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 13, 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Simple Summary:</strong> HabitOn does not collect, store, or share any of your personal data. All information stays on your device only.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        HabitOn is designed with your privacy as the top priority. The app <strong>does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information</strong> on external servers. All data created within the app, including your habits, completion logs, preferences, and settings, is stored locally on your device using your device's secure storage system.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        All app data is stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage (iOS) or SharedPreferences (Android). This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Habit names, descriptions, and schedules</li>
        <li>Completion logs and streak data</li>
        <li>Notification preferences</li>
        <li>App settings and preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>This data never leaves your device.</strong> We do not have access to your data, and it is not transmitted to any servers or third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. No Account Required</h2>
    <p>
        HabitOn does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share any personal information. You can use the app completely anonymously.
    </p>

    <h2>4. No Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        HabitOn does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not use:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analytics tools (no Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, etc.)</li>
        <li>Advertising networks</li>
        <li>Social media integrations</li>
        <li>Crash reporting services that transmit data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        HabitOn requests the following permissions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Used solely to send you reminders for your habits at times you specify. These are local notifications that do not transmit any data.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage</strong>: Used to save your habit data locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        No other permissions are requested or used.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device, it is protected by your device's security measures (passcode, biometric authentication, encryption). We recommend:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using a secure device passcode or biometric lock</li>
        <li>Keeping your device's operating system up to date</li>
        <li>Being cautious about who has physical access to your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        You have complete control over your data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Individual habits can be deleted at any time within the app</li>
        <li>All app data can be cleared using the "Clear All Data" option in Profile settings</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the app removes all associated data from your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. No Data Backup</h2>
    <p>
        HabitOn does not provide cloud backup or sync features. Your data exists only on your device. If you delete the app or lose your device, your data cannot be recovered. We recommend:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using your device's backup features (iCloud, Google Backup) to include app data in device backups</li>
        <li>Keeping your device secure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        HabitOn does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since no data is collected or transmitted, the app is safe for users of all ages. However, parental guidance is recommended for young children.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>

    <h2>12. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since HabitOn does not collect or process any personal data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>There is no data to access, rectify, or delete from our servers</li>
        <li>There is no data to port or transfer</li>
        <li>There are no automated decisions or profiling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All data is under your direct control on your device at all times.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> HabitOn is designed to be completely private. We don't collect your data because we can't – the app doesn't communicate with any servers. Your habits, your progress, and your data stay on your device, period.
